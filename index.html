          <h3><span class="bold">Definition of Robotics:</span> What is robotics and why is it important?</h3>
          <p>
            Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that involves the design, 
            construction, operation, and use oof robots. Robots are programmable machines capable of carrying
            out a series of comples tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. The field of robotics combines 
            aspects off mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence.

                providing the necessary foundation for mounting motors, sensors, wheels, controllers, 
                batteries, and other essential components. <br><br> The design and construction of the

                Joints are the pivotal components that connect different segments of a robot's structure, 
                allowing relative movement between them. They play a crucial role in enabling robots to 
                perform tasks that require flexibility, precision, and coordination, much like how human 
                joints enable movement in our limbs. <br><br> Joints are essential for determining a 
                robot's degrees of freedom (DoF), which define how a robot can move andd interact with its 
                environment. The design and configuration of the joints significantly impact the robot's 
                capabilities, such as its range of motion, speed, and accuracy.

                A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit (IC) designed to perform specific tasks 
                within an embedded system. In the context of robotics, microcontrollers serve as the brain 
                of the robot, managing the processing, control, and communication needed to perform various 
                functions. They integrate a processor, memory, input/output (|/O) peripherals, and often 
                analog and digital convertoers on a single chip, making them ideal for controlling robotics 
                systems.

            <h4>PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards):</h4>
            <p>
                Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are the foundational building blocks of most electronic devices, 
                including robotics. A PCB is a flat board made from non-conductive material that supports and 
                connects various electronic components using copper traces, pads, and other features etched 
                onto or between layers of the board. 
                <br><br>
                In robotics, PCBs serve as the central platform where microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, 
                power supplies, and other essential electronic components are mounted and interconnected. This 
                integration allows for the efficient operation of robotic systems, enabling precise control, 
                signal processing, and communication.

                Wiring in robotics refers to the electrical connections that link various components of a robot, 
                such as microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, power supplies, communication modules, and more. These 
                wires carry electrical signals and power, enabling the robot to function effectively by facilitating 
                communication between components.
                <br><br>
                Proper wiring ensures that all parts of a robotic system are powered, controlled, and synchronized 
                correctly. It plays a critical role in the robot's ability to perform tasks, respond to inputs, and 
                execute commands accurately and efficiently.

            <p>
              Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field that combines aspects of computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), and optics to enable machines to "see" 
              and interpret visual information. It involves the development of algorithms and models that can analyze images and videos to extract meaningful information, 
              such as identifying objects, detecting motion, or understanding scenes.

            <h4>Decision-Making</h4>
            <p>
              Decision making in robotics is the process of selecting actions or strategies from a set of possibilities to achieve a specific objective or respond to a 
              particular situation. It involves interpreting data from sensors, evaluating potential actions, and choosing the most appropriate one based on predefined 
              criteria or learned experiences.
